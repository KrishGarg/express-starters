# Express Starters

Some hand-made ExpressJS starters. All are in TypeScript but no ESM (As it was fucking hard to configure.)

## Templates

| Template Name | Description                                                                                                                | Degit                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Common        | The very common express app with nothing but an index.ts and a controller's folder, which can help manage via the MVC way. | `degit KrishGarg/express-starters#common`  |
| Testing       | The common one, but with testing configured with Jest and Supertest.                                                       | `degit KrishGarg/express-starters#testing` |
| Deta          | Very specific, but I might be using it, it's to host on [Deta](https://deta.sh). It has some special rules so yeah.        | `degit KrishGarg/express-starters#deta`    |
